Shredded document reconstruction using MPEG-7 standard descriptors (strips)
- grouping shreds into similar clusters based on mpeg-7 desccriptors. 
- specially usefull when establishing which shreds belong on the same page, out of a clump of shreds from many different documents.
- color descriptors worked very well, text ones not so well, perhaps because of the large difference between height and width of strips . Shape features had some effect if the shredder has a tendency to create a curvy cut.

Combining Forces to Reconstruct Strip Shredded Text Documents
- shows problem is NP hard
- reduce to travelling salesman problem
- uses approx TSP solution + simple cost function (gaussian over a couple edge pixels)
- alternative solution: Variable Neighbourhood search + human intervention

Meta-Heuristics for Reconstructing Cross Cut Shredded Text Documents
- introduces several seed solution heuristics (general greedy, row greedy, linear programming and Prim)
- does fully automated Variable Neighbourhood search algorithm (randomness + Variable Neighbourhood Descent which explores increasingly large and complex neighbourhoods looking greedily for a better solution)
- also does ant colony optimization, which gives better results than VNS but works slower
- cost function is similar to above, gaussian based edge pixel comparation
- performance is evaluated by difference between obtained and optimum cost

A Memetic Algorithm for Reconstructing Cross-Cut Shredded Text Documents
- uses combination of genetic programming and VNS
- cost function as above, gaussian based only on edge pixels match
- apparently best results so far

Hybrid Optimization Methods for Warehouse Logistics and the Reconstruction of Destroyed Paper Documents
- phd thesis, seems like a good review of some of the existing work
- appendix has a couple documents that have been used by several papers as a benchmark

The Deshredder: A Visual Analytic Approach to Reconstructing Shredded Documents
- based on the DARPA challenge
- human interaction fully integrated in workflow
- contains info on initial selection and straightening of pieces as well as using shape information

An Investigation into Automated Shredded Document Reconstruction using Heuristic Search Algorithms
- phd thesis, good overview of whole process. Edge detection, feature extraction, searching, matching etc

Strip Shredded Document Reconstruction using Optical Character Recognition
- uses machine learning techniques to identify matching edges based on cut off characters
- learns what the characters are from the text, then tries to identify to what character class a cut off char belongs, and then tries to match edges
- no real performance experiment is made, it is left at the level of "potential extra feature" for a cost function.
- only looks at cut edge characters for matching.

Document Analysis Applied to Fragments: Feature Set for the Reconstruction of Torn Documents
-only talks about manually torn paper, but uses document content analysis, so might be transferable
- tested on up to 690 snippets

Two Approaches for Computing Lower Bounds on the Reconstruction of Strip Shredded Text Documents
- looks into ILP methods
- Lagrangian relaxation and heuristics
- 99+% accuracy, however even 150 takes more than 20 minutes. Does not scale well.

An alternative clustering approach for reconstructing cross cut shredded text documents
- clustering approach for CCST, can be automatic or involve human
- new cost function, similar to gaussian diff except it only considers black pixels and it introduces several fail criteria that give a cost of infinity (not enough black pixels, mismatch between number of lines or between line alignment )
- uses simple greedy to construct and merge clusters
- uses nr of correct pairs as performance measure, better than "Meta-heuristics for reconstructing cross cut shredded text documents"
- How does it compare with "A Memetic Algorithm for Reconstructing Cross-Cut Shredded Text Documents" ? Could this be the best one ??
